## Logic

(Add some renders or photos of the module!)

A straightforward, no-nonsense quad logic processor. Triggers, gates, audio - whatever you want - can be mangled, merged and digested by logic gates and the result used in creative patches.

When fed audio, the logic processor will attempt to convert the audio into square waves. This can be pretty handy for making suboscillators (Especially when combined with a clock divider) or adding a bit of beef to an otherwise less interesting waveform.

Applying clocks and gates to the module can be especially helpful in creating generative rhythms and beats.

Inputs are copied down the A and B inputs (or in Eurorack terms, [normalled](https://learningmodular.com/glossary/normalled/)) if nothing is plugged in, saving from needing to use multiples to split out commonly used signals such as a clock.

## Patch examples

### Drums

(Some kind of drum demo, use the Drumfiend for pushing out drum triggers)

### Oscillator mangling

(Make some square waves)

### Filter pinging

(Ping an MS-20 filter)
