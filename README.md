## Hello!

Welcome to Divergent Waves. I started to build Eurorack synthesizer modules at the start of 2020, learning as I went. Now I'd like to share some of them with you.

## Modules

[Logic](module/logic/)

[DrumFiend](module/drumfiend/)

### Open Source

All Divergent Waves modules are open source. Kicad is used for schematic layout and PCB design, and Arduino/Teensyduino for Teensy-based projects.
