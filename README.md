## Welcome!

Welcome to Divergent Waves. I started to build Eurorack synthesizer modules at the start of 2020, learning as I went. Now I'd like to share some of them with you.

### Open Source

All Divergent Waves modules are open source. Kicad is used for schematic layout, PCB design, and panel layout. Arduino and CircuitPython are also used in various projects on the Teensy and Raspberry Pi Pico development boards.

### Contact

Do you have a burning question that hasn’t been answered elsewhere on the site? Perhaps you’re after something custom? Or some help with a module?

Please feel free to drop me an email and I’ll get back to you.
