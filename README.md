## Hello!

Welcome to Divergent Waves. Iâ€™m Tom, the creator of Divergent Waves. I started to build Eurorack synthesizer modules at the start of 2020, learning as I went and making a lot of fun mistakes along the way. Now I'd like to share some of these with you.

## Modules

### Open Source

All the Divergent Waves modules are open source. Kicad for schematic layout and PCB design, and Teensyduino for Teensy-based projects.
